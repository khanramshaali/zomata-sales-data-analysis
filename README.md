The dataset includes information on restaurant types, ratings, online order availability, booking options, votes, and approximate cost for two. The main goal is to uncover customer preferences, ordering behavior, and key business insights.

## Objective  
- Understand the relationship between restaurant types and online order preferences  
- Identify which restaurants receive the highest ratings and votes  
- Analyze cost preferences for couples  
- Determine patterns in booking tables and order modes
